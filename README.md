# village-scenery


This C++ project uses the OpenGL graphics library to draw a scene with a sky, field, sun, fence, trees, house, and clouds. The init function is used to set the background color and projection mode, the cloud and sun functions draw circles, and the fence function draws a rectangle with rounded corners. The display function is responsible for drawing all of the elements of the scene using a combination of graphics primitives and functions. This project demonstrates the use of basic OpenGL graphics concepts and functions to create a simple scene.
